                                    <p>
                                    
The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown,
<br><br>
when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood,
<br><br>
out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird
<br><br>
"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo" echoes through the quiet wood,
<br><br>
and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.
<br><br>
Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross
<br><br>
and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers.
<br><br>
One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree,
<br><br>
a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song.
<br><br>
Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree
<br><br>
that served her both for door and for window.
<br><br>
"Get away from here, sir," she said to the Grasshopper.
<br><br>
"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!"
<br><br>
But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right
<br><br>
to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak.
<br><br>
Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.
<br><br>
The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with
<br><br>
the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were
<br><br>
not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved.
<br><br>
So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.
<br><br>
"Well sir," she said, "if I must stay awake,
<br><br>
I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it,
<br><br>
I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus,
<br><br>
of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods.
<br><br>
Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me.
<br><br>
I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself."
<br><br>
The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words.
<br><br>
Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough
<br><br>
so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.
<br><br><br>


Flattery is not a proof of true admiration.
<br><br>
Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.
