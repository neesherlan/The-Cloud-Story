Once upon a time , there was an old couple living in
a small cottage at the edge of their rice field. The old
man and the old woman had been raising a hen that
had seven little chicks. The old couple had never
thought of killing them.
One day, a monk came to the old couple’s cottage.
The old couple thought that there would be no
breakfast for the monk the next day. (to have no food to offer to a
monk, would be considered a most disrespectful thing)
 “What should we cook for his breakfast?” the old man
asked. “Why don’t we kill the hen and raise seven little
chicks for breeding? The old woman replied.
They didn’t know that the little family heard what they
were talking about. The hen and seven little chicks burst
into tears. They felt very sad. After that, they ran away
into a forest. The hen felt terribly sad and she said to the
little chicks before she died “ If I die, you should be good
chicks and repay the kindness of the old couple.”
The next morning, the hen and seven little chicks
came back to the cottage. The old couple had a fire
ready and when the pot was hot the old woman caught
the hen and prepared to put her in the pot. When the
little chicks saw this, they ran together towards the fire.
By their merit, the seven little chicks were reborn as
seven little stars. This was their reward for their
gratitude and devotion to their mother. Now If you look
up the sky at night, you can see these seven little chicks
stars. We call these stars “Dao Lookgai”..
The end..
