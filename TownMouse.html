A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country.
<br><br>
For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns,
<br><br>
with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, 
<br><br>
nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner
<br><br>
making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.
<br><br>
After the meal the friends had a long talk, 
<br><br>
or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while 
the Country Mouse listened.
<br><br>
They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow 
<br><br>
and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. 
<br><br>
In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all 
the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. 
<br><br>
So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to 
go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.
<br><br>
When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived,
<br><br>
they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet.
<br><br>
There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed,
<br><br>
the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse 
<br><br>
was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door.
<br><br>
In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time,
<br><br>
hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, 
<br><br>
the door opened suddenly and in came the servants 
to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.
<br><br>
The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only 
long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.
<br><br>
"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not,
<br><br>
" she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food 
<br><br>
and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."
<br><br><br>


Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.
