A Wolf had been feasting too greedily,
<br><br>
and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. 
<br><br>
He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing.
<br><br>
Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.
<br><br>
So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill,
<br><br>
would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.
<br><br>
"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."
<br><br>
The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat.
<br><br>
But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.
<br><br>
When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.
<br><br>
"But what about my reward!" called the Crane anxiously.
<br><br>
"What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. 
<br><br>
"Haven't you got it? 
Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?"
<br><br><br>


Expect no reward for serving the wicked.
