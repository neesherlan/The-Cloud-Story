There was once a young Shepherd Boy
<br><br>
who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest.
<br><br>
It was rather lonely for him all day
<br><br>
so he thought upon a plan
<br><br>
by which he could get a little company and some excitement.
<br><br>
He rushed down towards the village
<br><br>
calling out
<br><br>
Wolf,Wolf.
<br><br>
and the villagers came out to meet him,
<br><br>
and some of them stopped with him for a consideration time.
<br><br>
This pleased the boy so much
<br><br>
that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick,
<br><br>
and again the villagers came to his help.
<br><br>
But shortly after this
<br><br>
a wolf actually did came out from the forest
<br><br>
and began to worry the sheep,
<br><br>
and the boy of course cried out
<br><br>
wolf, wolf”
<br><br>
still louder than before.
<br><br>
But the villagers, who had fooled twice before,
<br><br>
thought the boy was again deceiving them,
<br><br>
and nobody stirred to come to his help.
<br><br>
So the wolf made a good meal off the boy’s flock.
