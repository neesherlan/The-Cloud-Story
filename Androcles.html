A slave named Androcles
<br><br>
once escaped from his master and fled to the forest.
<br><br>
As he was wandering about there
<br><br>
he came upon a lion lying down moaning and groaning.
<br><br>
At first he turned to flee,
<br><br>
but finding that the lion did not pursue him,
<br><br>
he turned back and went up to him.
<br><br>
As he come near,
<br><br>
the lion put out his paw,
<br><br>
which was all swollen and bleeding
<br><br>
and found that a huge thorn had got into it,
<br><br>
and was causing all the pain.
<br><br>
He pulled out the torn
<br><br>
and bound up the paw of the lion,
<br><br>
who was soon able to rise
<br><br>
and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog.
<br><br>
Then the lion took Androcles to his cave,
<br><br>
and every day used to bring him meat from which to live
<br><br>
But shortly afterwards
<br><br>
both Androcles and the lion were captured.
<br><br>
and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the lion,
<br><br>
after the latter had been kept without food for several days.
<br><br>
The Emperor and all his court
<br><br>
came to see the spectacle,
<br><br>
and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena.
<br><br>
Soon the lion was let loose from his den
<br><br>
and rushed bounding and roaring toward its victim
<br><br>
But as soon as he come near to Androcles
<br><br>
he recognized his friend,
<br><br>
and fawned upon him,
<br><br>
and licked his hands like a friendly dog,
<br><br>
The Emperor, surprised at his,
<br><br>
summoned Androcles to him,
<br><br>
who told him the whole story.
<br><br>
Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed,
<br><br>
and the lion let loose to his native forest.
