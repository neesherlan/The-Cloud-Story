It so happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling to release 
himself lost all of it but the stump.
<br><br>
At first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes. 
But at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, 
and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them
<br><br>
When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails.
<br><br>
He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies, 
the dogs; how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold 
a friendly conversation with one another.
<br><br>
His friends failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance.
<br><br>
That is all very well, said one of the older foxes; but I do not think you 
would have recommended us to dispense
 with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself.
