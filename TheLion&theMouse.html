A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. 
<br><br>
A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright 
<br><br>
and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap,
<br><br>
the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
<br><br>
"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. 
<br><br>
"Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."
<br><br>
The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. 
<br><br>
But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
<br><br>
Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest,
<br><br>
the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself,
<br><br>
he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice
<br><br>
and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes
<br><br>
that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.
<br><br>
"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. 
<br><br>
"Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."
<br><br><br>


A kindness is never wasted.
